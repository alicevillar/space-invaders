# Space Adventure (space invaders)

Space Adventure is a game I created using Pygame library. 

I started this project when I saw the [demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhiO4WsHA6c) from [Chrisspresso](https://github.com/Chrispresso/SnakeAI).
I read his [project page](https://chrispresso.io/AI_Learns_To_Play_Snake) and then wanted to create my own version.
The architecture is similar, but I used my own images and added the following features :smiley: !


## Gameplay  

To play the game, use :
 
- `LEFT ARROW` to move left,
- `RIGHT ARROW` to move right,
- `SPACE` to shoot enemies
